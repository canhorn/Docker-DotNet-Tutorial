# About

This project will show off how to take an ASP.NET Core ReactJS Client application and split the ClientApp from the ASP.NET Core application.

## Branches

The application is broken up into branches that show the process of moving the application from one build/publish process to one that can work with Docker and separate developments.

### main/001_initial

This branch is from the default template from VS2019, with the csproj still containing the details to install/build/publish the ClientApp.
